I want to build a full-stack web application that allows users to provide the name of their favorite celebrity, and record themselves taking a pledge. This application will consist of a front-end interface, and a back-end service to load the pledge mapped to the user in the backend database, and store the video recording. The primary functionality should include:

Front-End:
A modal pop-up or overlay that is displayed when users click a “Record Your Pledge” button.
A form for users to select their grade in school (7th or 8th), their name, enter the name of their favorite celebrity, and load the pledge mapped to their name in the backend. The dropdown should only load those names from the backend into the dropdown if the video_submitted field is marked as “False” and belonging to the selected grade in school. There are 50 users whose names needs to be entered to the backend and mapped to 4 different pledges.
The ability for users to see the pledge dynamically displayed.
The displayed pledge should be personalized to include the user's name in the pledge. It should also include the text, “<favorite celebrity> is my favorite celebrity, and I nominate <favorite celebrity> to take this pledge with me.
Built-in recording controls to let users record themselves reading the pledge. The pledge text should remain visible while recording. The pledge text should be positioned such that while users read it off the screen, they would be looking as close to the camera as possible.
The users should be able to preview the recording to see if they like their recording. If not, they should be able to re-record the video. The audio of the recording should also be audible during the video preview.
A submission button that triggers the message, “Your video has been saved”. The video should be saved in the backend with a custom name that would be in the following format <name_grade_favoritecelebrity>.

Back-End:
A database table where I can upload different users' data with the following fields, id(auto-generated), names, grades, pledge_code, favorite_celebrity, video_submitted, and video_url. The <video_submitted> field is marked as “False” by default. The pledge_code field is a foreign_key from the pledges table.
The pledge_code field is the primary_key of the pledges table which has the 4 pledge texts.
Once a video is successfully submitted by a student, the field <video_submitted> should be marked as “True”.

Overall Application Flow:
User clicks “Record Your Pledge” and fills out the form in a modal.
The user should be able to scroll on the modal.
Once the user hits the "Record" button in the modal, there should be a countdown from 3 to 0 with preview before the actual recording starts so that the user can position themself correctly in front of the camera.
User records their pledge while seeing the pledge text while recording.
The users gets to preview the recording and record in case they want to modify the video
The back-end saves the video, makes the database entry to edit the users video_submitted field and triggers the no-code platform.

Additional Considerations:
Design the front-end to be responsive and user-friendly, with intuitive recording controls and clear visual cues.
Implement robust back-end validation to ensure the form fields are correctly formatted and that the video is successfully saved.
Ensure the entire workflow is secure, handles errors gracefully, and provides user feedback (e.g., confirmations, error messages) at each step.

Deliverables:
A front-end interface that handles user input, displays the pledge text, and enables video recording.
A back-end service that securely saves videos, and generates unique filenames.
